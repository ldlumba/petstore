# Implementation Plan: Petstore Commerce

**Branch**: `001-petstore-commerce` | **Date**: 2026-05-05 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-petstore-commerce/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a fullstack Petstore commerce application where shoppers can browse a responsive pet catalog, inspect pet details,
search and filter by type, price, age, and availability, and save pets to a cart or wishlist. The backend will expose
REST APIs for pet listing CRUD under the `/lumba/api/v1` route namespace using Java 17+, Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA,
and PostgreSQL, while the frontend will use React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and MUI for a polished responsive UI.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Java 17+ for backend; React (Vite) frontend  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Material UI (MUI)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL  
**Testing**: JUnit 5, Spring Boot test slices, React component/integration tests, and API contract tests  
**Target Platform**: Web application deployed to Render free-tier services  
**Project Type**: Fullstack web application  
**Performance Goals**: Initial catalog responses should render within 2 seconds on a standard browser connection, and
search/filter API requests should complete within 500 ms p95 for catalogs up to 1,000 pet listings on free-tier
infrastructure  
**Constraints**: Must use `/lumba/api/v1` API routes, `com.lumba.petstore` package naming, Docker-based local development, and
Render-compatible stateless services  
**Scale/Scope**: Pet catalog storefront plus admin CRUD for listings; no payment processing in this feature

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The constitution gates are satisfied:

- `/lumba/api/v1` public routes are required and respected by the planned API surface.
- `com.lumba.petstore` is the required backend package root.
- The stack is restricted to Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Docker, React, Tailwind CSS, and MUI.
- Render free-tier deployment requires stateless services and runtime configuration through environment variables.
- Commerce flows must be testable at the feature boundary, so API and UI coverage are part of the plan.

### Source Code (repository root)

```

**Structure Decision**: Use a two-app web structure with a Spring Boot backend under `backend/` and a React/Vite
frontend under `frontend/`. Feature documentation stays under `specs/001-petstore-commerce/`, with API contracts in
`specs/001-petstore-commerce/contracts/`.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations require justification at this stage.
